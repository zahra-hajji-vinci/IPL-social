# Description
This project implements a Passwordchecker class which allows you to check the validity of a password according to several safety criteria:

The password must contain at least 8 characters.
He must contain at least a special character (for example,!@#$%^&\*()).
It must contain at least one figure.
He should not contain the chain "IPL" (ignoring the breakage).

# Launch the code:
npm test

# Note : 
I apologize for the incorrect name of the test file. The file appSpec.js should have been named passwordChecker.test.js. I realized this at the end, but it was too late to rename it due to time constraints.
